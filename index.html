    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I'm a growth seeking individual, constantly learning new things in various areas of life. I look at things holistically; I find that there is no ultimate truth in one thing, but rather it's all the truths combined. My ongoing challenge and mission is combining all the identified truths into providing better solutions to existing problems.</p>
